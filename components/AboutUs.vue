                    <h4 class="col-span-2 text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">We’ve cultivated a well of experience as entrepreneurs, advisors, and investors ourselves. We know it’s easy for new companies to waste countless hours identifying and selecting the precise services they need to build their businesses and infrastructures. In many cases, important things fall through the cracks. Start-ups can get taken advantage of if they lack expertise, connections, negotiating power, or (as is often the case) the time and energy necessary to do all the due diligence and make the smartest choices. Since 2010 FundedBuy has been a trusted resource for companies to find advice, recommendations, price information, access to volume discounts, and the very best customer service to assist with their purchasing and budgeting decisions.</h4>
